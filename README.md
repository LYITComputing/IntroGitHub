## Tasks for completion


### __1. Initial setup__

After the forking the repository, the repository manager must enable GitHub pages and invite the other members of the team as collaborators.  

1. Go to the repository settings and enable GitHub Pages:
   1. Scroll down to the "GitHub pages" section.
   2. From the "Source" drop down, select __main branch__ and click save.
   3. Note the url of the repository.
2. Invite the other teams members to collaborate on the project:
   1. Go to the repository settings and select __manage access__.
   2. Click on the __invite a collaborator__ button and invite your team members.

</br>

### __2. Collaborate__

Now that the repository has some team members, you will each create a static web page for the repository GitHub pages:  

1. Each participant should create a new branch called <_CollabFeature_> where _Collab_ is you name.  
2. Within your branch navigate to the _posts folder.
3. Open the file 0000-01-01-intro.md and copy the text.
4. Create a new file called 0000-01-0x-_YourName_.md.
5. Paste the text that you copied from the  0000-01-01-intro.md file into your new file.
6. Edit the text and include a line or two stating your favourite programming language and why you like the language.
7. Commit the new file with a meaningful commit message and description.
8. After creating a new file, issue a pull request. The request should select the __main__ branch as the base: and __your branch__ as the compare.

</br>

### __3. Review and discuss__

Now that you have some pull requests you should review the suggested changes.  

Group members should review a pull request, suggest the order of each of the static files. You can change the order of the file by updating each file name. For example to make the file 0000-01-0x-_YourName_.md appear as the second file in the GitHub page change the name and replace the 'x' with '2' eg 0000-01-02-_YourName_.md.

### __4. Amend your files and publish__

1. Make the changes necessary to your files so that your page is displaed in the agreed order.
2. Commit and merge your changes with the main branch.
3. Check that each the repository site displays correctly. Go to the repository settings and scroll down to the GitHub Pages section. The URL for the repository site will be displayed there.  If the pages do not display correctly go to the issues section of the repository, create an issue and assign it to the appropriate team member.

This repository is based on the GitHub learning lab introduction to GitHub which is available here <https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github>

The repository is using the :sparkles: open source project [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/). If you are interested in how this works, head to the original project repo to learn more about the cool people behind this project.
